How to explain framework -
RD-
1) Pl -> python,core java
2) framework type - data driven framework,keyword driven by using page object model
3) - POM: As per the Page Object Model, we have maintained a class for every web page. Each web page has a separate class and that class holds the functionality
 and members of that web page. Separate classes for every individual test.

4) Packages: We have separate packages for Pages and Tests. All the web page related classes come under the Pages package and all the tests related classes come under
Tests package.
For example, Home Page and Login Page have separate classes to store element locators. For the login test, there would be a separate class which calls the methods
from the Home Page class and Login Page class.

5) properties file -- Properties file: This file (config.properties) stores the information that remains static throughout the framework such as browser-specific
information, application URL, screenshots path, etc.
All the details which change as per the environment and authorization such as URL, Login Credentials are kept in the config.properties file. Keeping these
 details in a separate file makes it easy to maintain.

6) Screenshots:  Screenshots will be captured and stored in a separate folder and also the screenshots of failed test cases will be added to the extent reports.

how u implemented oops concept in your framework

because of your effor team reaching the more towards goals
what is imapct on team because of u?

mukesh motwani -
1) test data- we dont hard code anything we save it in a different file.
if in case any data updation is there then we need to just change data here
no need to change whole data.

-test data - to maintain data and all data is in excel format and appace poi then using testng data provider to pass data to all test scripts
also use properties file

2) reports/logs
-extent/allure reports

3) utilities - it will common utility which save your code like reusable code
so each and every test script can use it

4) unit test framework - pytest ---> test script ---> pom(to generate test script using design pattern)

5) maven - build tool

6)Runner - jenkins,bamboo

we are using python as a programming language and we are using hybrid framework
IN this hybrid driven we are using data driven and modular driven

we have test data component which actually take care about data
in test data we have 2 data - test data is coming from excel file and second  is config file

for reporting - we are using allure/extent report

then another component is utility - basically take care of all standard utility

then the scripting part for that we are using pytest
we are using one of  design pattern called pom
using pom we have different pages based on that we create test scripts






Roles and reponsibilities -
Ans - motwani -
Automationa activities - development,execution,maintenance
I majorly involv in all testing activities,sprint planning ,retrospective,daily standup
also have automation  test which we are maintaining,development of the script,
development of the framework,execution and maintenance whenever we have new cycle or new build
we automated test cases and we see any failure we fix it and we re run it
some resources or backlog (we make progress in our framework in every sprint the enhancement)

 web/api/mobile
which tools are u using

Ans - RD automation -
