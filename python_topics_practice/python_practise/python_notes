#iw que - diff between remove() and pop()
remove() ->
1. we can use to remove special element from the list
2. it cant return any value
3. if special element not avaliable then we get VALUE ERROR

pop() ->
1. we can use to remove last element from the list
2. it returned removed element
3. if list is empty then we get error.

iw- difference between append() and insert()
# append() -> In list when we add any element it will come in last i.e it will be last element
# insert() -> In list we can insert any elements in particular index numbers

diff bet list and tuple -
list and tuple are exactly same except small difference: list objects are mutable where as Tuple objects are immutable
In both cases insertion order is preserved, duplicate objects are allowed,heterogeneous objects are allowed, index and slicing are
supported

List -
- list is a group of comma seperated value within square bracket and square brackets are manadatory.
e.g i = [12,43,21,32]
- list objects are mutable i.e once we create list object we can perform any changes in that object
- if the content is not fixed and keep on changing then we should go for List
- list objects can not used as keys for dictionaries because keys should be hashable and immutable


Tuple -
- tuple is a group of comma seperated values within parenthesis and parenthesis are optional
- tuple objects are immutable.i.e once we creates tuple object we cannot change its content
- if the content is fixed and never changes then we should go for tuple
- tuple objects can be used as keys for dictionaries because keys should be hashble and immutable
