poly means many. Morphs means forms.
Polymorphism means 'Many Forms'.
Eg1: Yourself is best example of polymorphism.In front of Your parents You will have one
type of behaviour and with friends another type of behaviour.Same person but different
behaviours at different places,which is nothing but polymorphism.
Eg2: + operator acts as concatenation and arithmetic addition
Eg3: * operator acts as multiplication and repetition operator
Eg4: The Same method with different implementations in Parent class and child
classes.(overriding)
Related to Polymorphism the following 4 topics are important

Overloading
 We can use same operator or methods for different purposes.
Eg 1: + operator can be used for Arithmetic addition and String concatenation
 print(10+20)#30
 print('durga'+'soft')#durgasoft
Eg 2: * operator can be used for multiplication and string repetition purposes.
 print(10*20)#200
 print('durga'*3)#durgadurgadurga
Eg 3: We can use deposit() method to deposit cash or cheque or dd
 deposit(cash)
 deposit(cheque)
 deposit(dd)

1)Operator Overloading:
 We can use the same operator for multiple purposes, which is nothing but operator
overloading.
 Python supports operator overloading

Eg 1: + operator can be used for Arithmetic addition and String concatenation
 print(10+20)#30
 print('durga'+'soft')#durgasoft
Eg 2: * operator can be used for multiplication and string repetition purposes.
 print(10*20)#200
 print('durga'*3)#durgadurgadurga
