Interfaces In Python:
In general if an abstract class contains only abstract methods such type of abstract class is
considered as interface.

Concreate class vs Abstract Class vs Inteface:
1) If we dont know anything about implementation just we have requirement
specification then we should go for interface.
2) If we are talking about implementation but not completely then we should go for
abstract class. (partially implemented class).
3) If we are talking about implementation completely and ready to provide service then
we should go for concrete class.
